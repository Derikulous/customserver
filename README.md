# Custom WebServer from scratch

## This webserver is developed from [practiceruby](https://practicingruby.com/articles/implementing-an-http-file-server?u=2c59db4496)

### How to use

In the **TERMINAL**, run ```ruby server.rb```.
A cute cat will greet you in the terminal if the server is running.

Go to your **BROWSER** and type in http://localhost:3000. On the main page, an image will be displayed
and solve once in for all the great debate "Miracle Whip vs. Mayonnaise"

Thanks to [TheOatmeal](http://theoatmeal.com/blog/miracle_whip) for the image.
